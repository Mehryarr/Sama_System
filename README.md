# Sama_System
This project aims to develop a system that can be used for universities to manage various aspects of academic activities, such as saving grades of students,
registering courses, scheduling exams, and generating transcripts. The system will be designed to be user-friendly, secure, scalable, and reliable.
The system will also provide various features and functionalities to support the needs and preferences of different users, such as students, instructors,
administrators, and staff. The project will follow an agile methodology and use appropriate tools and technologies to implement the system.
The project will also include testing, evaluation, and documentation of the system.
